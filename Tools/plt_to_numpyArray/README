This script processes simulation output data from plt files. It can convert data into .npy format and optionally display 3D visualizations of specified variables.

Package dependences:
numpy>=1.23.0
yt>=4.0.1
matplotlib>=3.5.1
Users can run pip3 install -r requirements.txt to install necessary packages.

Usage of plt_to_numpyArray.py:
First users may modify experiments_path to the path of the directory containing experiment file.
In current example, it's /Users/haorancheng/Desktop/data_etl/Data/ which contains experiment000019.

Second, users may modify simulations_path to the path of the directory containing plt data specified 
in experiment file. In current example, it's /Users/haorancheng/Desktop/data_etl/Data/ which contains
Bubble_AMR as specified in experiment000019

Third, run 'sh run.sh' to start data processing and visualization.
Users can modify command 'python3 plt_to_numpyArray.py -v experiment000019 y_velocity 3 yes' as wanted to:
1. Specify which experiment to run. In current example, its' experiment000019.
2. Specify which Physical variable to be transformed and potentially visualized. For example, change the
command to 'python3 plt_to_numpyArray.py experiment000019 x_velocity y_velocity 3 yes' to process both x_velocity
and y_velocity.
3. Choose to visualize chosen variable or not. Command line can be changed to 
'python3 plt_to_numpyArray.py experiment000019 y_velocity 3 no' to turn off visualization.
4. Choose not to print out numpy array shape and level number by deleting '-v'.
