IAMReX documentation
====================

This IAMReX repo extends the capability of original `IAMR <https://amrex-fluids.github.io/IAMR/>`_ codes, aiming at simulating the multiphase incompressible flows and fluid structure interaction problems on both CPUs and GPUs with/without subcycling. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved on an adaptive semi-staggered grid using the projection method. The gas-liquid interface is captured using the level set (LS) method. The fluid-solid interface is resolved using the multidirect forcing immersed boundary method (IBM). The particle-wall as well as the particle-particle collisions are also captured by the adaptive collision time model (ACTM).
